# Installation on Linux

There are two prerequisite C/C++ libraries for this R package.

* cfitsio:
  - A library of C and Fortran subroutines for reading and writing data files in
    FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data format.
  - For download and installation details, go to
    http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html

* gsl:
  - A library of C subroutines that provides a wide range of mathematical
    functions.
  - This library should have been readily installed in many Linux systems.
  - If not already installed, download the library from
    http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/


Ignore the following installation instrucation and edit the src/Makevars file to
point to the right include and lib path. Then invoke the following,

$ R CMD INSTALL gRavity


--- FOR FUTURE INSTALLATION OPTION, IGNORE FOR NOW ---
There are two ways to install the R package. First, by passing the necessary
paths to the oifitslib through --configure-args input option.

$ R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=' \
  --with-cfitsio-include=/path/to/cfitsio/include \
  --with-cfitsio-lib=/path/to/cfitsio/lib' \
  gRavity

#--no-multiarch --with-keep.source --configure-args='--with-cfitsio-include=$HOME/Toolbox/c/include --with-cfitsio-lib=$HOME/Toolbox/c/lib'

Second, by passing the necessary paths to the oifitslib through environment
settings.

$ setenv CFITSIO_INCLUDE /path/to/cfitsio/include
$ setenv CFITSIO_LIB /path/to/cfitsio/lib
$ R CMD INSTALL gRavity
--- FOR FUTURE INSTALLATION OPTION, IGNORE FOR NOW ---


# Installation on Mac OS X

The installation procedure is similar to the above but in order to install
oifitslib, an additional library, glib2, has to be first installed. The
latter is not usually pre-installed on a Mac OS X machine but can be obtained
from one of several package managers, e.g. MacPorts (https://www.macports.org),
Homebrew (http://brew.sh) or Fink (http://www.finkproject.org).

Below is a procedure to install this package based on MacPorts.

1. Install XCode and its Command Line Tools
2. Install MacPorts
3. Install gsl with MacPorts (e.g. "sudo port install gsl")
4. Install cfitsio with MacPorts (e.g. "sudo port install cfitsio")
5. Install the R package as documented above.


# Installation on Windows

The procedure to install this package on to a Windows machine is currently not
available. However, the authors would be happy to support any such installation
by keen users so that a standard procedure can be determined and added here in
the future.
